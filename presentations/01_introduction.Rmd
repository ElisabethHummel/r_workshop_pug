- R is open source, with tons of additional packages that are developing rapidly.
- Managing your "dependencies" can be a bit overwhelming.
- Embrace the quirkiness :-)

## What can you expect?
<div class="columns-2">
  ![](pics/programming_learning_curve.jpg)

- You can't learn a language in 2 days.
- **But** you will acquire the basic skills for the journey ahead.
- Learning is only possible by doing. **No excuses: Start. Using. Code. Now!**
</div>

## Coding is good for you
![](pics/automatisation.png)

- Eventually saves time and reduces copy-paste mistakes.
- Key to reproducible science.

## Googling is okay
<div class="columns-2">
  ![](pics/stack_overflow.jpg)

- You don't need to know how to do it - but you need to know where to look.
- Googling, browsing Stack Overflow etc. will be part of your workflow.
